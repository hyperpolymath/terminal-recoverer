Sentinel is a continuity steward for the terminal environment.  
Its purpose is to reduce irreversible loss, preserve context during failure, and
provide structured artefacts that support investigation and recovery.

== Purpose

Sentinel exists to:

* maintain a persistent recovery workspace (`tmux` session)
* optionally record interactive terminal sessions
* capture structured crash bundles when `systemd-coredump` fires
* minimise loss of shell history
* operate quietly, predictably, and only with explicit user consent

== Scope

Sentinel governs the following domains:

* user-level systemd services
* interactive shell logging
* crash-capture pipelines
* timestamped artefact storage

It does *not* modify system configuration, escalate privileges, or alter user data
outside its own directories.

== Invariants

Sentinel guarantees:

* no logging occurs unless explicitly enabled
* all artefacts are timestamped and isolated
* all behaviour is reversible and user-controlled
* no background load beyond journal tailing
* no mutation of user data outside `~/Documents/terminal-logs` and `~/Documents/crash-captures`

== Lifecycle

Sentinel is activated through:

* `terminal-recoverer.service` at login
* `terminal-recoverer-coredump.service` for crash watching
* optional shell logging via `ENABLE_TERMINAL_LOGGING=1`

Deactivation is immediate and leaves no residual state beyond stored artefacts.

== Identity

Sentinel is a quiet steward, not a daemon.  
It preserves continuity through clarity, not through prediction or intervention.
